'''Randy Marsh''' is the son of [[Marvin Marsh|Marvin]] and [[Grandma Marsh]], the husband of [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]], and the father of [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Shelly Marsh|Shelly]]. He makes his debut in the [[Season One]] episode "[[Volcano]]", and is voiced by [[Trey Parker]].

Despite being a geologist with a doctorate, he is generally portrayed as an absent-minded idiot, driving many episode plots in the later seasons, though this was later revealed to be due to him being unhappy over his marriage. However, in earlier seasons he was calmer and more level-headed, often providing advice to the boys. In "[[You're Getting Old]]", he divorced his wife and moved away. However, in "[[Ass Burgers]]" he reconciled with Sharon and remarried, therefore getting their old house back. Since [[Season Twenty-Two]], Randy has been running the [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] hemp farming business.

Randy is named after and based upon [[Trey Parker]]'s father, Randy Parker, who is also a geologist.

==Background==
===Political Views===
Randy Marsh is shown to be an actual liberal. He often fights for huge changes and only turns to conservatism when he is in a major problem, goes into an obsession stance, or misunderstands something. His liberalism is first seen in "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", when he tells the people of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] that they have to fart all the time in order to avoid being burned alive. He was also shown to support the people of the future in "[[Goobacks]]", and thinks of them just as normal people. He even grounds Stan for calling these people Goobacks in a fast food restaurant, but his grounding was lifted after Randy loses his job to one of those people from the future. In "[[About Last Night...]]" Randy's political views are confirmed after he is seen supporting [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. In "[[Member Berries]]", he strongly supported [[Hillary Clinton]]'s run for presidency but made it clear this was an unusual occurrence and was only supporting her because of his dislike of [[Herbert Garrison]], although he is briefly enticed by Garrison's run in "[[The Damned]]".

===Sexual Appetite===
As first seen in "[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]", Randy has a very unhealthy addiction to masturbation. He often masturbates without thinking straight and becomes obsessive on whatever he is masturbating on. In "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]", he was watching [[Mrs. Tenorman]] take her bra off. Later, in "[[Over Logging]]", he sneaks in the room where the internet is hidden then goes on it and starts looking at unusual pornographic material. In "[[Crème Fraiche]]", he was beating it to cooking shows. This soon became an obsession and it forced Sharon to give Randy an "old fashioned" in order to end his obsession and save their marriage.

===Alcoholism===
[[File:BloodyMary (44).png|thumb|Randy and his "disease" of alcoholism]]
In "[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]", "[[Clubhouses]]", and "[[The Losing Edge]]", it was hinted that Randy has a drinking problem. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] also mentioned it in "[[Grey Dawn]]", at one point stating, "''Looks like Stan's dad's been hitting the bottle again.''" His problem was more closely examined in "[[Bloody Mary]]" after he was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving. He got a DUI and his driver's license was suspended. The judge made him go around schools including [[South Park Elementary]] to explain to kids why heavy drinking is bad, and sentenced him to 2 weeks of [[Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)|Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. As a result of the A.A meetings, Randy misunderstands the concept of alcoholism and believes that only spirituality can cure him of this.

He has been depicted as everything from a casual drinker to a heavy alcoholic. He still is not as bad as [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s father, [[Stuart McCormick]], as, unlike the latter, he is sober most of the time. He also had a job until he got himself fired in "[[About Last Night...]]" for a drunken tirade directed toward his boss. (It was revealed, though, that he was re-hired as a geologist in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]"). It appears Randy Marsh is a binge drinker - one who stays most of the time sober but drinks heavily at suitable instances. He might have a family history of alcoholism because his son Stan was seen getting drunk in order to avoid his cynicism in "[[You're Getting Old]]".

He was shown to still have a drinking problem in "[[Freemium Isn't Free]]" and "[[Stunning and Brave]]" although he denied this in both cases.

===Marijuana===
[[File:TesticularCancer-Randy.transparent.png|thumb|left]]
Randy has an unhealthy attraction to marijuana, going as far as to intentionally giving himself cancer just so he could get his hands on legal marijuana. He tried many ways to get cancer, such as smoking, getting a tan, and attaching cell phones to his face. He eventually came up with the idea of sticking his testicles in a microwave, as seen in "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]", just to get weed. Ten other men, including [[Jimbo]] and [[Ned]], soon follow Randy's example.

Despite being drawn to marijuana in the aforementioned episode, he seems to display some level of contempt for it in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", as not only do he and Sharon hire someone to scare Stan from drugs, he also is the one to defame marijuana at the end as he points out that the worst thing about pot is that one could be doing something better with their life instead of smoking it.

Ultimately, Randy purchases a hemp farm in [[Season Twenty-Three]] and gives up geology to begin his own marijuana business, [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]].

===Musical Talent===
It appears Randy Marsh is very musically talented, and occasionally the show states that he once had dreams of being a famous musician. He is a good singer and he can play guitar really well as seen in "[[Guitar Queer-O]]" and "[[Over Logging]]". He also sang and played the guitar in "[[You're Getting Old]]", but this was not a display of good talent.

In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", it's revealed that Randy was part of a boy band in the 1980s called "[[The Ghetto Avenue Boys]]". His group was successful for a few years, but he and the other members were quickly replaced due to getting "too old."

Randy began performing again in "[[You're Getting Old]]", presumably out of a midlife crisis but quit because it was causing trouble in his marriage. He performed "tween wave" in [[Mick's Bowling]] under the stage name Steamy Ray Vaughn.

As shown in "[[The Cissy]]", he eventually achieved success as [[Lorde]], although in this case, it was due to his voice being changed with computers although it was implied in "[[Handicar]]" that he also plays guitar in Lorde's music. He eventually ended his music career in "[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]", after an embarrassing live performance at The [[Pepsi Center]] and becoming disillusioned with the music industry and their use of holograms.

===History===
It is also implied in "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", that Randy and his wife, Sharon used to be [[Hippies]], and they met at Woodstock in 1969. If this was the case, though, they would be in their mid-forties to mid-fifties. However, this may have been simply a cutaway joke. Also, Randy and Sharon were revealed to have met in a tree-fort playing Truth or Dare, in "[[Clubhouses]]".

Randy tells the other adults in town, at the end of "[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]", that he studied [[Mongolians|Mongolian]] in college, possibly minoring in the subject. He then speaks it to the children, who have joined a tribe of Mongolians. However, it appears that he does not apply his knowledge of the language to his life, as this is the only time he is heard speaking it. He may also have a Ph.D. in Geology as he has been called Dr. Marsh on two separate occasions (although one of those times was himself).

In "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", Randy makes a [[World of Warcraft]] account (which is named Falcorn and is a level 2 human hunter, which is not possible in the actual game at the time of the episode's creation) after seeing his son Stan play it.

In "[[Pinewood Derby]]" he makes Stan cheat in his derby race, accidentally discovers warp drive, and consequently becomes the first contact for aliens coming to Earth. He and the leaders of the world keep trying to cover their lies. He grounded Stan for telling the truth, however, he and the others lied to the aliens. As punishment for failing that test so badly, Earth and the Moon are permanently enclosed in a gigantic, cubical force field and isolated from the rest of the Universe — to which Randy says, "Well, that sucks."

===Vehicles Owned===
Randy has driven red sedans, Lexus RX300s, and Lincoln Navigators. In "[[Smug Alert!]]", he is seen driving a Honda Civic Hybrid.

===Careers and Occupations===
Randy is currently a hemp farmer. He has had numerous other occupations throughout the series, the most notable one being a geologist.

====Boy-Band Singer====
[[File:SomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger065.png|thumb|Randy in his band.]]
In "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]", Randy reveals to Stan that he was in a boy band when he was eighteen, after having been in a choir during high school. He was so eager about this new career, that he dropped out of school, left his girlfriend and his family, and immediately joined a boy band. The name of his band was The Ghetto Avenue Boys, which is meant to be a parody of The Backstreet Boys. They had a hit single, "''You Got It''", and they made millions, living in a big mansion with dozens of women sharing his bed with him at once. But one year later, all of the group members were fired for being too old for a boy band, despite the fact that Randy was only nineteen at the time. Randy was in debt to the studio, and in order to make up for it, he had to give up all of his possessions. He then returned home at last and used up what money he had left resuming his education.

An interesting thing to note is that Randy is shown to be very proficient at the guitar in "[[Guitar Queer-O]]". He also mentions in that episode that he knows how to play several famous rock songs on the guitar, such as ''[[Carry On Wayward Son]]'' by Kerry Livgren.

====Geologist====
[[File:SpontaneousCombustion020.png|thumb|Randy as a scientist.]]
Ever since his first appearance, he has been shown to be a geologist. In later seasons, notably in the [[Season Eight]] episode "[[Goobacks]]", he is known to be a worker for the United States Geological Survey. He became famous for his theory on moderation in "[[Spontaneous Combustion]]", and won the Nobel Prize Award for it. He is often called upon to perform many scientific tasks, due to his education and positions. He usually is unable to perform the tasks despite the fact he is a geologist and thus has a high level of understanding of many areas of science, including chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics. However, his skills in geology might not be that good as well, as in "[[Volcano]]" he had to call someone to figure out why the "needle thing" was moving and what it meant when the mountain was smoking, and even after discovering it was a volcanic eruption, he casually finishes his coffee first.
He lost his job in "[[About Last Night...]]" for verbally and physically abusing his boss and then punching him because he thought he did not need his job now that Obama was president. Randy was eventually re-hired, as first seen in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]" when he tells Stan that he saw his new [[Facebook]] page while at the office.

He may hold a Ph.D. in geology as he has been referred to as Dr. Marsh on two occasions; once by a Republican Senator in "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]" and once by himself in "[[T.M.I.]]" while he was teaching children about penis measurement. The Surgeon General rebuked his complicated formula for measuring a penis; she does not consider him to be qualified enough, which is hardly surprising as his doctorate is in Geology, not human sexuality.

In the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode "[[Tegridy Farms]]", he moves his family to [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] and starts a new weed business, presumably quitting his geologist job.

====Wall-Mart Employee====
In "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", Randy worked at the [[Wall-Mart]] in [[South Park]] until [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] saved him from being killed as the store was destroyed in the end.

====[[South Park Elementary]] Chef====
[[File:CremeFraiche19.png|thumb|right|Randy as a celebrity school chef in the cafeteria.]]
Randy becomes obsessed with cooking after seeing the [[Food Network]] in "[[Crème Fraiche]]". He loves it so much, that he becomes the boys' new cafeteria chef. He creates his own show, called "[[Cafeteria Fraiche]] ". Other celebrities of the Food Network then challenge him to a cook-off. However, he used this position mostly just to show off his cooking skills rather than serving meals to the students.

====Tween Wave Singer====
[[File:YoureGettingOld047.png|thumb|Randy Marsh as "Steamy Ray Vaughn".]]
In "[[You're Getting Old]]", Randy impulses his career as a solo singer of a popular musical genre called "Tween Wave" naming himself as "Steamy Ray Vaughn".

====Broadway Bro====
In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]" Randy begins to write, compose, and direct a musical play originally titled ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen''. After making having a bro down and making amends with the [[Broadway Bros]], they agree to help Randy with the musical and re-title it as [[The Woman in White]]. It is unknown if the musical was ever completed.

====Sarcastaball Coach====
[[File:Sarcastaball014.png|thumb|right|Randy as the school's sarcastaball coach.]]
Randy ironically invents the sport of [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|sarcastaball]] in the aptly named "[[Sarcastaball]]", but no one realizes he is being sarcastic and the school makes him the coach of [[South Park Elementary]]'s sarcastaball team. Eventually, the NFL is officially replaced with a sarcastaball league and Randy becomes the coach of the [[Denver Broncos]] until he drinks [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] cum, causing him to make his first genuine comment in a long while and curing him of his sarcasm disorder.

====Blockbuster Owner====
In "[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]" Randy purchases [[Blockbuster]] for $10,000. The dialogue suggests he may have owned what was left of the entire business. Randy is driven to madness due to the lack of customers and everyone telling him that renting is outdated. After Shelly burns down the store, the Marsh family gets some of their money back from insurance and Randy goes back to his job as a geologist.

====[[South Park Mall]] Security====
[[File:SongofAssandFire00014.png|thumb|right|Randy as the mall's head of security.]]
In [[Season Seventeen|Season Seventeen's]] "[[Black Friday]]" trilogy, Randy takes a second job as a security officer at the mall. He tells everyone it's to earn some extra holiday cash, but in truth he wants to be inside the mall on Black Friday before everyone else so he can shop on great deals before things get too hectic. After the former chief of security is killed by an out-of-control parent anticipating the new [[Stop Touching Me Elmo|Elmo]] doll, he is promoted to succeed him. Randy becomes upset when all the security guards he grew to like keep dying.

====Lorde====
In "[[Gluten Free Ebola]]", Randy performs at the end party as Lorde. This is carried on to the next episode, "[[The Cissy]]" where he is revealed to have a double life as Lorde and is secretly hiding cash he earns for writing the songs inside the walls of their house. He wrote the song "Hunger Games (Ya-Ya-Ya)" and "[[Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)]]".

In "[[REHASH|#REHASH]]", Lorde performed at The Women of Rock concert at the [[Pepsi Center]] where he embarrassed his daughter with the lewd performance.

In "[[HappyHolograms]]" Randy helps defeat the Record Producer's hologram performers at the ''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]''.

====Cock Magician====
In "[[Cock Magic]]", Randy shows the boys his own interpretation of Cock Magic, which involves him doing magic tricks with his penis. Later, he performs at a kindergartner's birthday party, with horrible results. Even later in the episode, Randy performs yet again at [[Panda Express]].

====Hemp Farmer====
After moving his family to the [[Tegridy Farms (Location)|Tegridy Farms]] in the [[Tegridy Farms|eponymous episode]] of the [[Season Twenty-Two]], Randy becomes a hemp farmer, starting a new weed business. In the season finale "[[Bike Parade]]", Sharon tells Randy that the hemp farm was a bad business idea because people barely buy from him, but Randy manages to get a lot of customers during the Amazon strike, expanding his business with the help of [[Towelie (Character)|Towelie]].

===Obsessions===
Randy has an extremely addictive personality and has more unhealthy obsessions than any other adult in South Park (although this is also partly because he is one of the most prominent adults in the show). Sharon tries to dissuade him but tends to fail.

==Criminal Record==
*'''Assault''': In "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", Randy chops off [[Future Stan]]'s hand when Stan attempts to expose his parent's lie by pretending to cut off his own. In "[[The Losing Edge]]", it is revealed that he constantly gets arrested for getting in fights and keeps doing it on screen and in "[[About Last Night...]]", he was extremely drunk and punched his boss in the nose which caused him to be fired (at least temporarily). Randy is the antagonist of two fights in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', as Drunk Randy and Red Wine Drunk Randy, demanding his keys.
*'''Theft''': In "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]], he hijacked a person's car just so he could go to Best Buy to play World of Warcraft.
*'''Murder:''' In "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]", he kills Glen because he was starting to act like a homeless person and in "[[Titties and Dragons]]", he kills a fellow security guard for wanting to get out of duty during Black Friday. In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]" he floods a theater killing and drowning [[Larry Feegan]], although he did this inadvertently. In "[[Band in China]]", he strangles [[Winnie the Pooh]] to death in order to appease the Chinese government so he can expand his cannabis business on an international scale.
*'''Drunk Driving:''' In "[[Bloody Mary]]", he drives drunk which causes him to be arrested and as a result has his driver's license revoked. Randy has had his keys taken away from him on multiple occasions to keep him from driving drunk.
*'''Arson:''' In "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", he burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs. In "[[Mexican Joker]]", he bombs numerous home-grown cannabis crops in the backyards of people's homes, causing death and destruction.
*'''Cheesing:''' In "[[Major Boobage]]", it is implied that he had been cheesing as he knew of the side effects.
*'''Indecent Exposure:''' In "[[Cock Magic]]", he performs tricks with his penis in front of kindergarteners. 
*'''Mass Murder:''' In "[[Mexican Joker]]", Randy conspires with two representatives from a billion-dollar cannabis company to get rid of home-grown cannabis, and bombs numerous people's crops in their backyards, killing many in the process so he and his co-conspirers can corner the market on cannabis.
*'''Unlicensed Slaughter:''' In "[[Let Them Eat Goo]]", after selling his own "plant-based" burgers (cannabis edibles) to boost business, Randy and Towelie are manipulated into killing many cows by The Goo Man (under the assumption that a ranch farmer is simply filling Randy's farm with "useless" cows, as Randy promoted veganism and plant-based foods, making beef obsolete when The Goo Man actually paid him to help sabotage Randy's business). Since these are cows, this can be seen as common slaughter, but as Randy did not have a proper slaughterhouse set up this can be seen as unlicensed slaughter. While this is illegal, Randy only did this due to the fact that the cows were polluting his farm with their waste, eating his crops, and preventing him from harvesting his crops.
*'''Sale/Distribution of Recreational Marijuana; Violation of the Controlled Substances Act:''' Ever since "[[Tegridy Farms]]", Randy has started a business which involves selling and distributing recreational marijuana to others. While this is technically legal in the state of Colorado, it is still a federal crime, and it violates the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
*'''Sale, Production and Distribution of Contaminated/Illicit Substances:''' In "[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]" while promoting his new cannabis strain the "Halloween Special".. Randy sells cannabis contaminated with a hazardous chemical concoction (of furniture polisher, paint thinner, bleach, ammonia, and antifreeze) by his daughter Shelly. He initially was going to discard it but after seeing that the concoction enhanced the cannabis Randy decided to sell it as planned, but without examining it to see if what was safe for usage. The contaminated cannabis was shown to have caused Randy and Towelie to have nightmarish hallucinations and was heavily implied by Mayor McDaniels to have "poisoned" people causing serious harm to everybody. While Shelly is at fault for contaminating the product, Randy is also accountable as he witnessed Shelly contaminate his product and decided to sell it anyway. In "[[Christmas Snow]]" when Santa has the sale and purchase of alcohol banned during the holidays in an effort to decrease the town's amount of drunk driving, the townspeople go to Randy for cannabis to use to help give them some "holiday spirit". As it was winter and his crops were dead Randy was left with the decision of selling old strains or combining them to make a new strain. Since this was not good enough by Randy's standards he decides to combine strains and then visibly lace them with cocaine. When initially asked what the white substance was he said it is "Just a little something extra, for a special kick". Later when Mayor McDaniels confronted him on what the white substance was, Randy confirmed it was in fact cocaine, and that Randy did not even know cocaine was illegal to begin with and that he could not just sell it to people without them knowing. Immediately after Randy started protests to legalize cocaine for medicinal and recreational usage, succeeding in making cocaine legal in seven U.S. states including Colorado. While cocaine distribution became legal after this whatever cocaine Randy had sold and distributed beforehand was both illegal and immoral. Even after Randy had cocaine legalized there was massive collateral damage done to the town due to cocaine intoxication.
*'''Bestiality:''' In "[[The Pandemic Special]]", it is revealed Randy had sex with a bat and a pangolin while he was in China, together with [[Mickey Mouse]]. However, this was because he was drunk with Mickey and thus intoxicated into having sex with the bat and pangolin.

==Appearance==
[[File:Volcano024.png|thumb|left|Randy's first appearance in "[[Volcano]]".]]
Randy wears a white shirt under a blue-cyan jacket with two pockets on each side and the sleeves up, he also wears black pants and black shoes. His left-side pocket usually has a yellow, a red, and a blue pen with a pocket protector. As of "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]", Randy has been given a slightly more detailed redesign, such as the pencil and pens in his chest pocket changing colors and no longer being depicted as simple lines.

He has thick, black hair with parted bangs, and a thick black mustache, both of which seem to evoke a 1970s hairstyle. In early episodes, though, his hairstyle was somewhat different (see left). Up until "[[Chickenlover]]", he did not have a dimpled chin. But in and after that episode he mysteriously developed one (of course, in the early stages of [[South Park]], many things changed).

At bedtime, Randy wears deep blue pajamas with a long-sleeved shirt and gray slippers. Though he appears slim and in shape when clothed, he is rather flabby, and has a protruding stomach, as seen when naked. Randy also has prosthetic testicles following the removal of his own due to his self-induced testicular cancer as seen in [[Season Fourteen]]'s "[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]".

In his special occasion outfit, which consists of a white dress shirt, a light blue tuxedo, blue pants, and a gold tie, he has a gold handkerchief in his blue coat pocket. In later seasons it changed to a brown tuxedo, white dress shirt, grey pants, and a red tie.

As of "[[Tegridy Farms]]", Randy now wears a straw hat, a blue plaid shirt underneath a brown hooded jacket, a black belt with a gold buckle, filthy greenish-gray pants, and muddy brown shoes.

In "[[Christmas Snow]]" he had a gray beard and was wearing a red coat with white buttons and black suspenders.

In the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Randy is now an elderly man with grey hair, which is balding at the top. He reverts back to his attire preceding "[[Tegridy Farms]]", with the only differecnes being that he wears a light brown coat over his blue shirt and instead of black shoes, he sports a pair of brown sandals with grey socks underneath.

==Personality==
[[File:Randydrunkdriving.jpg|thumb|left|Randy gets caught drinking and driving]]
Randy is often portrayed as an intelligent but simultaneously dim-witted, quick to think, naive man, while all the same a caring, doting father. However, he is also obsessive and when he gets engrossed in something, his personality turns to the exact opposite. He becomes immature, childish, and dumb during the obsession phases. He has a habit of being led astray by new fads or events, like many of the characters. All the same, he has also been known to go completely against such things, though his reasons are usually selfish and immature. He will also try to do a heroic thing, but will then be distracted due to a selfish reason as seen in "[[Insheeption]]". However, this was caused by [[Mr. Mackey]] because Randy ignored the psychiatrist's wanting about Mackey's dream being so unstable. Another aspect and common trait of Randy is that he will often take up a cause, but they hypocritically abandon that cause or objective whenever he sees it as something that will damage his reputation or finds something else that will be beneficial for himself or his family. Such instances of this are in "[[Margaritaville]]", when he led the townspeople to abandon all material possessions and economic activities in order to "please the economy", but when Kyle decided to pay for everyone's debt, he was one of the people in line who chose to have his debt paid for, immediately abandoning his previous beliefs. Another instance is in "[[Naughty Ninjas]]", when he sought out Officer Barbrady to shoot kids who they thought were part of ISIS. But when he found out that they were just playing ninjas and Officer Barbrady accidentally shot [[David]], he immediately blamed Officer Barbrady, along with the Mayor and her staff. When Officer Barbrady reminded Randy that he'd told him "to shoot some kids", Randy insists that he was saying it as a question and tries to shift all the blame from him and target the very person he'd sought out for help.

Randy also seems to drink a lot of coffee, shown carrying a cup in most episodes he is in at one point or another.

Randy has a tendency to act very melodramatically. Whenever things get surreal in the show, and Randy is calling for his son, he usually puts on an act of being very ill and weak, and moaning Stan's name out: "''Staaaaaan!''". Randy is also shown to be a hypochondriac, as revealed by Stan in "[[Bloody Mary]]".

In "[[My Future Self n' Me]]", "[[Future Stan]]" reveals that Randy does not like chicken. He also does not like cherry pop-tarts, as he expressed disgust when [[Linda Stotch]] pointed out that those were the only ones left in "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]".

In "[[Guitar Queer-O]]", Randy can be seen strumming a guitar with his right hand; he may, therefore, be right-handed.

He is obsessive with a few things, as evidenced with his video camera in "[[Pandemic]]" when he videotaped his father [[Marvin Marsh]] in the bathtub, Sharon, Stan and Shelly eating dinner (which is implied to have happened multiple times), a [[Peruvian Pan Flute Music|Peruvian flute band]] outside the house (asking Stan to go outside next to them), Sharon and Shelly watching CNN, Sharon talking to the Broflovskis and Tuckers about their missing boys, Sharon calling someone to help with the missing boys and the [[Furry Death|gargantuan guinea pigs rampaging through town]]. Sharon frequently reprimanded him for doing this, calling him an idiot at one point.

===Violence===
Randy is shown to be very violent at times. He often is in mobs and flips over [[Korn]]'s truck. He chops off a [[Future Stan|man's]] hand, and perhaps kills him, in order to stop Stan from knowing that he was a fake in "[[My Future Self n' Me]]". He is shown in the end of "[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]" fighting with [[Skeeter]]. He is shown to be very violent again in "[[The Losing Edge]]", beating up rival baseball dads. He shoots off a man's head when he fears the man is becoming homeless when homeless people take over the town. He beats up a woman in "[[T.M.I.]]" after she questions his theory about penis sizes, implying that Randy is hostile to anyone who accuses him of having a small dick (which also explains [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] personality). He also gets sent to anger management and then takes over a FedEx building with Cartman, [[Tuong Lu Kim]], [[Goth Kids|Michael]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. He also joins the civil war re-enactors with Cartman and loots, rapes, and tortures.

In "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]", he was armed with a shotgun, while hiding with other parents on top of the community center. While he did not use his weapon against the surrounding homeless, he did decapitate [[Glen]] as punishment for being homeless.

In "[[Band in China]]", he kills Winnie The Pooh, in order to sell his weed in China.

==Family==
===[[Sharon Marsh]]===
[[File:InformativeMurderPorn072.png|thumb|left|Randy with his wife, Sharon.]]
She is Randy's wife. They married as Randy was dressed as Christopher Columbus, instead of an ordinary groom, much to her dislike. She seems to be more sensible than him at the best of times, although they both are known to be very hotheaded on occasion. In "[[Clubhouses]]", they were constantly bickering, and ultimately they divorce. Randy then became an incompetent father who spent the whole time partying the nights away, and never seemed to have time for his children. At the end of the episode, Sharon decided she still loved Randy, and they had sex in Stan's tree fort. They then presumably remarried. Up until this episode, they had been inseparable from each other; afterward, they are still loving, but their relationship is a bit more complicated. In more recent seasons, Sharon has become more annoyed with Randy's over-the-top and childish behavior, such as the events of "[[Pandemic]]", where she freaks out and attacks him when he spends all his time playing with a video camera while the family's lives are in danger. Even worse, this turned out to be pointless, as he had forgotten to put film in the camera. In "[[You're Getting Old]]", they divorced due to his actions. Sharon and Randy both confess to faking their happiness in their relationship. However, after communicating, they've become more aware of each other's feelings, and they reconcile in "[[Ass Burgers]]" and remarry.

===[[Stan Marsh]]===
[[File:Stan-marsh-0.png|thumb|left|Randy's son, Stan]]
Stan is Randy's son, and youngest child. Randy loves his son very much, and goes out of his way to either protect or save him, as shown in episodes "[[Grey Dawn]]", "[[Die Hippie, Die]]", "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]" and "[[Pee]]". Stan, however, gets very annoyed and frustrated by Randy's reckless and embarrassing behavior, and usually only takes his advice because he feels obliged to do so.

In "[[About Last Night...]]", Stan got so irritated by the street party outside which was being led in large part by his father, that he made a noise complaint. All he could say when they tipped [[Officer Barbrady]]'s car over was, "''Jesus Christ!''" and continued to watch in annoyed horror as his father's action became steadily worse. Things in-fact became even worse when Randy refused to help with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s younger brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], who had fallen out of the window and Randy ended up getting fired from his job for acting like a drunk-idiot towards his boss. Also, it may be noted that Stan did not want his parents to move back together in "[[Ass Burgers]]", this may be also taken as a sign that he does not like his father's behavior. In "[[Sarcastaball]]" Stan said Randy exaggerates every disease he gets. However, Stan sometimes thanks Randy when the latter helps him, such as saying to him "You're the greatest" in "[[The Losing Edge]]" when Randy got him disqualified from Baseball, despite looking down on his behavior beforehand.

Randy will also publicly vocally express his annoyance in certain incidences in which Stan was a part of, most of the time being incredibly harsh in situations that do not call for it.

===[[Shelly Marsh]]===
[[File:Shelly.png|thumb|Randy's daughter, [[Shelly]].]]
Shelly is Randy's daughter, and elder child. She is very violent to her younger brother, Stan, although she is very nice or at least indifferent whenever her parents are around. Because of this, Randy and Sharon have remained completely oblivious to her abusive nature. and when Stan told them what she did, they did not believe him. Shelly, however, like Stan and Sharon often gets annoyed with her father's behavior, rolling her eyes but rarely saying anything other than, "Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"

In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]", Randy drove all the way to the musical to prevent Shelly from giving a blowjob to [[Larry Feegan]].

Shelly does not feel like he loves her, claiming that he does not even try to get to know her in "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]". Randy responds saying that he really wants to but he feels like she hates him. Their relationship deteriorates quite a bit once the family moves to Tegridy Farms, as Shelly has a "marijuana problem".

===[[Marvin Marsh]]===
He is Randy's ancient father, who is 102 years old. He is suicidal, though everyone merely laughs at his requests to be killed, saying, "''That's our silly Grampa!''" In "[[Grey Dawn]]", he was frustrated by the way Randy spoke to him as if he were speaking to his son, rather than his father. Stan then explained that that was partly why Grampa waged the war between the young and the elderly because he did not want to be "treated like he was 12". In "[[Fantastic Easter Special]]" it is revealed that Marvin brought Randy to the [[Hare Club for Men]] when he was little. In "[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]", Marvin claims to have never wanted children and that Randy was "supposed to be nothing but the dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties"; this possible resentment may partly explain the strain on their relationship.

===[[Grandma Marsh]]===
[[File:Grandma Marsh.jpg|thumb|Randy's mother, [[Grandma Marsh]].]]
She is Randy's mother. She was once married to [[Marvin Marsh]]. However, due to the fact that they do not live together and Marvin had a sexual encounter with a contortionist in "[[Quintuplets 2000]]", this would imply that she also left Marvin eventually. She is currently suffering from an unknown illness in the hospital. She frequents Facebook, and often calls Randy to bully [[Stan Marsh]] into keeping up with her Facebook status as seen in "[[You Have 0 Friends]]".

===[[Jimbo Kern]]===
Jimbo is Randy's brother-in-law. They appear to have a decent friendly relationship, often drinking together and talking about normal guy stuff.

*''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'' - Appears to have aged along with the other adults in the show.

==Video Games==
===''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''===
Although its canonicity is disputed, Randy Marsh plays a major role in the video game as an assistant to the player in the "Mountain Pass" level where [[Volcano|his geology station is among the locations under attack]], informing the boys to look out for the threat of [[ManBearPig]] while noting humorously he is "''gonna have a beer!''" He reappears at the level's end to let the player know [[Timmy Burch]] is correct that they must next visit Downtown. He is not a playable character.

===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===
Randy plays a role in the plot as the most prominent adult in the game, up to the point where [[The New Kid]] is abducted by [[Visitors|aliens]], in which they meet him on the ship. He tells them that this is the price they pay for living in a small mountain town and gives them assistance in escaping the ship. The player has to play a rhythm-based mini-game to help get the probing machine out of Randy's ass.

After being rescued from the probing machine, Randy can be found at the [[Community Center]], when they want to place the Goth Kid's notice on the table. He is a member of the community council where he teaches players the Sneaky Squeaker fart, which can be used to distract guards. To get a photo, the New Kid hands over a USB stick with information, but the council does not listen to the whole thing and so does not know the real reason the military is in South Park.

Later on in the game, they meet him at the [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic]], disguised as a woman and trying to find out why the military is interested in the medical records of the women of South Park. The player must prove they are a doctor by giving him an abortion, the first step involves painfully numbing his balls, despite the fact that Randy's balls are [[Medicinal Fried Chicken|prosthetic]]. After completion of the area, he returns to the community center until players are in the final area of the game, stating that the government had planted a snuke in [[Mr. Slave|Mr. Slave's]] rectum and the only way to get it out is with somebody who can both shrink in size and perform abortions.

The abortion performed on the Snuke is identical to the abortion performed on Randy.

===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===
Randy plays a lesser role in the plot compared to the first game, but still helps set the scene for how South Park is seriously going downhill.

[[The New Kid]] first meets Randy on their first day buffing out scratches on his car. He tells the New Kid he'll follow them if they find out who's been keying his car and leaving nasty notes, as he is concerned it's a jilted lover. 

On their first night in the mission "[[The Bowels of the Beast]]", with [[Captain Diabetes]] by their side, the New Kid learns it's a beer-drunk Randy keying his own car and insulting Sharon, who is telling him to stop from the window. They refuse to allow him to drive drunk, and he fights them, shouting lines like "I thought this was America!" - a line which fans will recognise Randy has shouted multiple times on the show when becoming inebriated and violent.

Later, drunk on red wine, he smashes into the back room of the Italian Restaurant, saving the New Kid from the Italians, but still drunkenly demanding his keys, and getting into another fight when once again New Kid and Captain Diabetes refuse to hand the keys over. The line '"Red wine drunk is the worst kind of drunk" is used by the Italians. 

The player can from the second day find Randy in the Community Center as they did in the previous game, and get him as a Follower.

He shows up on the inauguration day of the new mayor and is starting a speech before he is interrupted.
